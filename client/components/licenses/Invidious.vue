      Version 3, 19 November 2007

      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim
      copies<br />
      of this license document, but changing it is not
      allowed.
    </p>

    <p>Preamble</p>

    <p>
      The GNU Affero General Public License is a free,
      copyleft license for<br />
      software and other kinds of works, specifically
      designed to ensure<br />
      cooperation with the community in the case of network
      server software.
    </p>

    <p>
      The licenses for most software and other practical
      works are designed<br />
      to take away your freedom to share and change the
      works. By contrast,<br />
      our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee
      your freedom to<br />
      share and change all versions of a program--to make
      sure it remains free<br />
      software for all its users.
    </p>

    <p>
      When we speak of free software, we are referring to
      freedom, not<br />
      price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to
      make sure that you<br />
      have the freedom to distribute copies of free software
      (and charge for<br />
      them if you wish), that you receive source code or can
      get it if you<br />
      want it, that you can change the software or use
      pieces of it in new<br />
      free programs, and that you know you can do these
      things.
    </p>

    <p>
      Developers that use our General Public Licenses
      protect your rights<br />
      with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software,
      and (2) offer<br />
      you this License which gives you legal permission to
      copy, distribute<br />
      and/or modify the software.
    </p>

    <p>
      A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is
      that<br />
      improvements made in alternate versions of the
      program, if they<br />
      receive widespread use, become available for other
      developers to<br />
      incorporate. Many developers of free software are
      heartened and<br />
      encouraged by the resulting cooperation. However, in
      the case of<br />
      software used on network servers, this result may fail
      to come about.<br />
      The GNU General Public License permits making a
      modified version and<br />
      letting the public access it on a server without ever
      releasing its<br />
      source code to the public.
    </p>

    <p>
      The GNU Affero General Public License is designed
      specifically to<br />
      ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code
      becomes available<br />
      to the community. It requires the operator of a
      network server to<br />
      provide the source code of the modified version
      running there to the<br />
      users of that server. Therefore, public use of a
      modified version, on<br />
      a publicly accessible server, gives the public access
      to the source<br />
      code of the modified version.
    </p>

    <p>
      An older license, called the Affero General Public
      License and<br />
      published by Affero, was designed to accomplish
      similar goals. This is<br />
      a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL,
      but Affero has<br />
      released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits
      relicensing under<br />
      this license.
    </p>

    <p>
      The precise terms and conditions for copying,
      distribution and<br />
      modification follow.
    </p>

    <p>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

    <p>0. Definitions.</p>

    <p>
      &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the
      GNU Affero General Public License.
    </p>

    <p>
      &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws
      that apply to other kinds of<br />
      works, such as semiconductor masks.
    </p>

    <p>
      &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable
      work licensed under this<br />
      License. Each licensee is addressed as
      &quot;you&quot;. &quot;Licensees&quot; and<br />
      &quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or
      organizations.
    </p>

    <p>
      To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or
      adapt all or part of the work<br />
      in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other
      than the making of an<br />
      exact copy. The resulting work is called a
      &quot;modified version&quot; of the<br />
      earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the
      earlier work.
    </p>

    <p>
      A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified
      Program or a work based<br />
      on the Program.
    </p>

    <p>
      To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything
      with it that, without<br />
      permission, would make you directly or secondarily
      liable for<br />
      infringement under applicable copyright law, except
      executing it on a<br />
      computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation
      includes copying,<br />
      distribution (with or without modification), making
      available to the<br />
      public, and in some countries other activities as
      well.
    </p>

    <p>
      To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of
      propagation that enables other<br />
      parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction
      with a user through<br />
      a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
      conveying.
    </p>

    <p>
      An interactive user interface displays
      &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;<br />
      to the extent that it includes a convenient and
      prominently visible<br />
      feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright
      notice, and (2)<br />
      tells the user that there is no warranty for the work
      (except to the<br />
      extent that warranties are provided), that licensees
      may convey the<br />
      work under this License, and how to view a copy of
      this License. If<br />
      the interface presents a list of user commands or
      options, such as a<br />
      menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
      criterion.
    </p>

    <p>1. Source Code.</p>

    <p>
      The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the
      preferred form of the work<br />
      for making modifications to it. &quot;Object
      code&quot; means any non-source<br />
      form of a work.
    </p>

    <p>
      A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface
      that either is an official<br />
      standard defined by a recognized standards body, or,
      in the case of<br />
      interfaces specified for a particular programming
      language, one that<br />
      is widely used among developers working in that
      language.
    </p>

    <p>
      The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work
      include anything, other<br />
      than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the
      normal form of<br />
      packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of
      that Major<br />
      Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the
      work with that<br />
      Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface
      for which an<br />
      implementation is available to the public in source
      code form. A<br />
      &quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a
      major essential component<br />
      (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific
      operating system<br />
      (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a
      compiler used to<br />
      produce the work, or an object code interpreter used
      to run it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in
      object code form means all<br />
      the source code needed to generate, install, and (for
      an executable<br />
      work) run the object code and to modify the work,
      including scripts to<br />
      control those activities. However, it does not include
      the work's<br />
      System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or
      generally available free<br />
      programs which are used unmodified in performing those
      activities but<br />
      which are not part of the work. For example,
      Corresponding Source<br />
      includes interface definition files associated with
      source files for<br />
      the work, and the source code for shared libraries and
      dynamically<br />
      linked subprograms that the work is specifically
      designed to require,<br />
      such as by intimate data communication or control flow
      between those<br />
      subprograms and other parts of the work.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Corresponding Source need not include anything
      that users<br />
      can regenerate automatically from other parts of the
      Corresponding<br />
      Source.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Corresponding Source for a work in source code
      form is that<br />
      same work.
    </p>

    <p>2. Basic Permissions.</p>

    <p>
      All rights granted under this License are granted for
      the term of<br />
      copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided
      the stated<br />
      conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms
      your unlimited<br />
      permission to run the unmodified Program. The output
      from running a<br />
      covered work is covered by this License only if the
      output, given its<br />
      content, constitutes a covered work. This License
      acknowledges your<br />
      rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
      copyright law.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may make, run and propagate covered works that you
      do not<br />
      convey, without conditions so long as your license
      otherwise remains<br />
      in force. You may convey covered works to others for
      the sole purpose<br />
      of having them make modifications exclusively for you,
      or provide you<br />
      with facilities for running those works, provided that
      you comply with<br />
      the terms of this License in conveying all material
      for which you do<br />
      not control copyright. Those thus making or running
      the covered works<br />
      for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under
      your direction<br />
      and control, on terms that prohibit them from making
      any copies of<br />
      your copyrighted material outside their relationship
      with you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted
      solely under<br />
      the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not
      allowed; section 10<br />
      makes it unnecessary.
    </p>

    <p>
      3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From
      Anti-Circumvention Law.
    </p>

    <p>
      No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective
      technological<br />
      measure under any applicable law fulfilling
      obligations under article<br />
      11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December
      1996, or<br />
      similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention
      of such<br />
      measures.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal
      power to forbid<br />
      circumvention of technological measures to the extent
      such circumvention<br />
      is effected by exercising rights under this License
      with respect to<br />
      the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to
      limit operation or<br />
      modification of the work as a means of enforcing,
      against the work's<br />
      users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid
      circumvention of<br />
      technological measures.
    </p>

    <p>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</p>

    <p>
      You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source
      code as you<br />
      receive it, in any medium, provided that you
      conspicuously and<br />
      appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
      copyright notice;<br />
      keep intact all notices stating that this License and
      any<br />
      non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7
      apply to the code;<br />
      keep intact all notices of the absence of any
      warranty; and give all<br />
      recipients a copy of this License along with the
      Program.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may charge any price or no price for each copy
      that you convey,<br />
      and you may offer support or warranty protection for a
      fee.
    </p>

    <p>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</p>

    <p>
      You may convey a work based on the Program, or the
      modifications to<br />
      produce it from the Program, in the form of source
      code under the<br />
      terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of
      these conditions:
    </p>

    <p>
      a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that
      you modified<br />
      it, and giving a relevant date.
    </p>

    <p>
      b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that
      it is<br />
      released under this License and any conditions added
      under section<br />
      7. This requirement modifies the requirement in
      section 4 to<br />
      &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.
    </p>

    <p>
      c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under
      this<br />
      License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.
      This<br />
      License will therefore apply, along with any
      applicable section 7<br />
      additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all
      its parts,<br />
      regardless of how they are packaged. This License
      gives no<br />
      permission to license the work in any other way, but
      it does not<br />
      invalidate such permission if you have separately
      received it.
    </p>

    <p>
      d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each
      must display<br />
      Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has
      interactive<br />
      interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
      Notices, your<br />
      work need not make them do so.
    </p>

    <p>
      A compilation of a covered work with other separate
      and independent<br />
      works, which are not by their nature extensions of the
      covered work,<br />
      and which are not combined with it such as to form a
      larger program,<br />
      in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium,
      is called an<br />
      &quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its
      resulting copyright are not<br />
      used to limit the access or legal rights of the
      compilation's users<br />
      beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of
      a covered work<br />
      in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply
      to the other<br />
      parts of the aggregate.
    </p>

    <p>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</p>

    <p>
      You may convey a covered work in object code form
      under the terms<br />
      of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey
      the<br />
      machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms
      of this License,<br />
      in one of these ways:
    </p>

    <p>
      a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a
      physical product<br />
      (including a physical distribution medium),
      accompanied by the<br />
      Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical
      medium<br />
      customarily used for software interchange.
    </p>

    <p>
      b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a
      physical product<br />
      (including a physical distribution medium),
      accompanied by a<br />
      written offer, valid for at least three years and
      valid for as<br />
      long as you offer spare parts or customer support for
      that product<br />
      model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
      either (1) a<br />
      copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software
      in the<br />
      product that is covered by this License, on a durable
      physical<br />
      medium customarily used for software interchange, for
      a price no<br />
      more than your reasonable cost of physically
      performing this<br />
      conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br />
      Corresponding Source from a network server at no
      charge.
    </p>

    <p>
      c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a
      copy of the<br />
      written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.
      This<br />
      alternative is allowed only occasionally and
      noncommercially, and<br />
      only if you received the object code with such an
      offer, in accord<br />
      with subsection 6b.
    </p>

    <p>
      d) Convey the object code by offering access from a
      designated<br />
      place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent
      access to the<br />
      Corresponding Source in the same way through the same
      place at no<br />
      further charge. You need not require recipients to
      copy the<br />
      Corresponding Source along with the object code. If
      the place to<br />
      copy the object code is a network server, the
      Corresponding Source<br />
      may be on a different server (operated by you or a
      third party)<br />
      that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided
      you maintain<br />
      clear directions next to the object code saying where
      to find the<br />
      Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts
      the<br />
      Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure
      that it is<br />
      available for as long as needed to satisfy these
      requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
      e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer
      transmission, provided<br />
      you inform other peers where the object code and
      Corresponding<br />
      Source of the work are being offered to the general
      public at no<br />
      charge under subsection 6d.
    </p>

    <p>
      A separable portion of the object code, whose source
      code is excluded<br />
      from the Corresponding Source as a System Library,
      need not be<br />
      included in conveying the object code work.
    </p>

    <p>
      A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a
      &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any<br />
      tangible personal property which is normally used for
      personal, family,<br />
      or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or
      sold for incorporation<br />
      into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a
      consumer product,<br />
      doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.
      For a particular<br />
      product received by a particular user, &quot;normally
      used&quot; refers to a<br />
      typical or common use of that class of product,
      regardless of the status<br />
      of the particular user or of the way in which the
      particular user<br />
      actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the
      product. A product<br />
      is a consumer product regardless of whether the
      product has substantial<br />
      commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless
      such uses represent<br />
      the only significant mode of use of the product.
    </p>

    <p>
      &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User
      Product means any methods,<br />
      procedures, authorization keys, or other information
      required to install<br />
      and execute modified versions of a covered work in
      that User Product from<br />
      a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The
      information must<br />
      suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of
      the modified object<br />
      code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely
      because<br />
      modification has been made.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you convey an object code work under this section
      in, or with, or<br />
      specifically for use in, a User Product, and the
      conveying occurs as<br />
      part of a transaction in which the right of possession
      and use of the<br />
      User Product is transferred to the recipient in
      perpetuity or for a<br />
      fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is
      characterized), the<br />
      Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must
      be accompanied<br />
      by the Installation Information. But this requirement
      does not apply<br />
      if neither you nor any third party retains the ability
      to install<br />
      modified object code on the User Product (for example,
      the work has<br />
      been installed in ROM).
    </p>

    <p>
      The requirement to provide Installation Information
      does not include a<br />
      requirement to continue to provide support service,
      warranty, or updates<br />
      for a work that has been modified or installed by the
      recipient, or for<br />
      the User Product in which it has been modified or
      installed. Access to a<br />
      network may be denied when the modification itself
      materially and<br />
      adversely affects the operation of the network or
      violates the rules and<br />
      protocols for communication across the network.
    </p>

    <p>
      Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation
      Information provided,<br />
      in accord with this section must be in a format that
      is publicly<br />
      documented (and with an implementation available to
      the public in<br />
      source code form), and must require no special
      password or key for<br />
      unpacking, reading or copying.
    </p>

    <p>7. Additional Terms.</p>

    <p>
      &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that
      supplement the terms of this<br />
      License by making exceptions from one or more of its
      conditions.<br />
      Additional permissions that are applicable to the
      entire Program shall<br />
      be treated as though they were included in this
      License, to the extent<br />
      that they are valid under applicable law. If
      additional permissions<br />
      apply only to part of the Program, that part may be
      used separately<br />
      under those permissions, but the entire Program
      remains governed by<br />
      this License without regard to the additional
      permissions.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at
      your option<br />
      remove any additional permissions from that copy, or
      from any part of<br />
      it. (Additional permissions may be written to require
      their own<br />
      removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)
      You may place<br />
      additional permissions on material, added by you to a
      covered work,<br />
      for which you have or can give appropriate copyright
      permission.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this License,
      for material you<br />
      add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the
      copyright holders of<br />
      that material) supplement the terms of this License
      with terms:
    </p>

    <p>
      a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability
      differently from the<br />
      terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
    </p>

    <p>
      b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable
      legal notices or<br />
      author attributions in that material or in the
      Appropriate Legal<br />
      Notices displayed by works containing it; or
    </p>

    <p>
      c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that
      material, or<br />
      requiring that modified versions of such material be
      marked in<br />
      reasonable ways as different from the original
      version; or
    </p>

    <p>
      d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of
      licensors or<br />
      authors of the material; or
    </p>

    <p>
      e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for
      use of some<br />
      trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
    </p>

    <p>
      f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors
      of that<br />
      material by anyone who conveys the material (or
      modified versions of<br />
      it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the
      recipient, for<br />
      any liability that these contractual assumptions
      directly impose on<br />
      those licensors and authors.
    </p>

    <p>
      All other non-permissive additional terms are
      considered &quot;further<br />
      restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.
      If the Program as you<br />
      received it, or any part of it, contains a notice
      stating that it is<br />
      governed by this License along with a term that is a
      further<br />
      restriction, you may remove that term. If a license
      document contains<br />
      a further restriction but permits relicensing or
      conveying under this<br />
      License, you may add to a covered work material
      governed by the terms<br />
      of that license document, provided that the further
      restriction does<br />
      not survive such relicensing or conveying.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this
      section, you<br />
      must place, in the relevant source files, a statement
      of the<br />
      additional terms that apply to those files, or a
      notice indicating<br />
      where to find the applicable terms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be
      stated in the<br />
      form of a separately written license, or stated as
      exceptions;<br />
      the above requirements apply either way.
    </p>

    <p>8. Termination.</p>

    <p>
      You may not propagate or modify a covered work except
      as expressly<br />
      provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to
      propagate or<br />
      modify it is void, and will automatically terminate
      your rights under<br />
      this License (including any patent licenses granted
      under the third<br />
      paragraph of section 11).
    </p>

    <p>
      However, if you cease all violation of this License,
      then your<br />
      license from a particular copyright holder is
      reinstated (a)<br />
      provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder
      explicitly and<br />
      finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently,
      if the copyright<br />
      holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
      reasonable means<br />
      prior to 60 days after the cessation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Moreover, your license from a particular copyright
      holder is<br />
      reinstated permanently if the copyright holder
      notifies you of the<br />
      violation by some reasonable means, this is the first
      time you have<br />
      received notice of violation of this License (for any
      work) from that<br />
      copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to
      30 days after<br />
      your receipt of the notice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Termination of your rights under this section does not
      terminate the<br />
      licenses of parties who have received copies or rights
      from you under<br />
      this License. If your rights have been terminated and
      not permanently<br />
      reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses
      for the same<br />
      material under section 10.
    </p>

    <p>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</p>

    <p>
      You are not required to accept this License in order
      to receive or<br />
      run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a
      covered work<br />
      occurring solely as a consequence of using
      peer-to-peer transmission<br />
      to receive a copy likewise does not require
      acceptance. However,<br />
      nothing other than this License grants you permission
      to propagate or<br />
      modify any covered work. These actions infringe
      copyright if you do<br />
      not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
      propagating a<br />
      covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this
      License to do so.
    </p>

    <p>10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.</p>

    <p>
      Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient
      automatically<br />
      receives a license from the original licensors, to
      run, modify and<br />
      propagate that work, subject to this License. You are
      not responsible<br />
      for enforcing compliance by third parties with this
      License.
    </p>

    <p>
      An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction
      transferring control of an<br />
      organization, or substantially all assets of one, or
      subdividing an<br />
      organization, or merging organizations. If propagation
      of a covered<br />
      work results from an entity transaction, each party to
      that<br />
      transaction who receives a copy of the work also
      receives whatever<br />
      licenses to the work the party's predecessor in
      interest had or could<br />
      give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to
      possession of the<br />
      Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor
      in interest, if<br />
      the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable
      efforts.
    </p>

    <p>
      You may not impose any further restrictions on the
      exercise of the<br />
      rights granted or affirmed under this License. For
      example, you may<br />
      not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for
      exercise of<br />
      rights granted under this License, and you may not
      initiate litigation<br />
      (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
      alleging that<br />
      any patent claim is infringed by making, using,
      selling, offering for<br />
      sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
    </p>

    <p>11. Patents.</p>

    <p>
      A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who
      authorizes use under this<br />
      License of the Program or a work on which the Program
      is based. The<br />
      work thus licensed is called the contributor's
      &quot;contributor version&quot;.
    </p>

    <p>
      A contributor's &quot;essential patent claims&quot;
      are all patent claims<br />
      owned or controlled by the contributor, whether
      already acquired or<br />
      hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some
      manner, permitted<br />
      by this License, of making, using, or selling its
      contributor version,<br />
      but do not include claims that would be infringed only
      as a<br />
      consequence of further modification of the contributor
      version. For<br />
      purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot;
      includes the right to grant<br />
      patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the
      requirements of<br />
      this License.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive,
      worldwide, royalty-free<br />
      patent license under the contributor's essential
      patent claims, to<br />
      make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise
      run, modify and<br />
      propagate the contents of its contributor version.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent
      license&quot; is any express<br />
      agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to
      enforce a patent<br />
      (such as an express permission to practice a patent or
      covenant not to<br />
      sue for patent infringement). To &quot;grant&quot;
      such a patent license to a<br />
      party means to make such an agreement or commitment
      not to enforce a<br />
      patent against the party.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a
      patent license,<br />
      and the Corresponding Source of the work is not
      available for anyone<br />
      to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this
      License, through a<br />
      publicly available network server or other readily
      accessible means,<br />
      then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding
      Source to be so<br />
      available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the
      benefit of the<br />
      patent license for this particular work, or (3)
      arrange, in a manner<br />
      consistent with the requirements of this License, to
      extend the patent<br />
      license to downstream recipients. &quot;Knowingly
      relying&quot; means you have<br />
      actual knowledge that, but for the patent license,
      your conveying the<br />
      covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of
      the covered work<br />
      in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable
      patents in that<br />
      country that you have reason to believe are valid.
    </p>

    <p>
      If, pursuant to or in connection with a single
      transaction or<br />
      arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring
      conveyance of, a<br />
      covered work, and grant a patent license to some of
      the parties<br />
      receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,
      propagate, modify<br />
      or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then
      the patent license<br />
      you grant is automatically extended to all recipients
      of the covered<br />
      work and works based on it.
    </p>

    <p>
      A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it
      does not include within<br />
      the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of,
      or is<br />
      conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the
      rights that are<br />
      specifically granted under this License. You may not
      convey a covered<br />
      work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
      party that is<br />
      in the business of distributing software, under which
      you make payment<br />
      to the third party based on the extent of your
      activity of conveying<br />
      the work, and under which the third party grants, to
      any of the<br />
      parties who would receive the covered work from you, a
      discriminatory<br />
      patent license (a) in connection with copies of the
      covered work<br />
      conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or
      (b) primarily<br />
      for and in connection with specific products or
      compilations that<br />
      contain the covered work, unless you entered into that
      arrangement,<br />
      or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March
      2007.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nothing in this License shall be construed as
      excluding or limiting<br />
      any implied license or other defenses to infringement
      that may<br />
      otherwise be available to you under applicable patent
      law.
    </p>

    <p>12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.</p>

    <p>
      If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court
      order, agreement or<br />
      otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
      License, they do not<br />
      excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you
      cannot convey a<br />
      covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
      obligations under this<br />
      License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
      consequence you may<br />
      not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to
      terms that obligate you<br />
      to collect a royalty for further conveying from those
      to whom you convey<br />
      the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those
      terms and this<br />
      License would be to refrain entirely from conveying
      the Program.
    </p>

    <p>
      13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU
      General Public License.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this License,
      if you modify the<br />
      Program, your modified version must prominently offer
      all users<br />
      interacting with it remotely through a computer
      network (if your version<br />
      supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive
      the Corresponding<br />
      Source of your version by providing access to the
      Corresponding Source<br />
      from a network server at no charge, through some
      standard or customary<br />
      means of facilitating copying of software. This
      Corresponding Source<br />
      shall include the Corresponding Source for any work
      covered by version 3<br />
      of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated
      pursuant to the<br />
      following paragraph.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notwithstanding any other provision of this License,
      you have<br />
      permission to link or combine any covered work with a
      work licensed<br />
      under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into
      a single<br />
      combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The
      terms of this<br />
      License will continue to apply to the part which is
      the covered work,<br />
      but the work with which it is combined will remain
      governed by version<br />
      3 of the GNU General Public License.
    </p>

    <p>14. Revised Versions of this License.</p>

    <p>
      The Free Software Foundation may publish revised
      and/or new versions of<br />
      the GNU Affero General Public License from time to
      time. Such new versions<br />
      will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
      may differ in detail to<br />
      address new problems or concerns.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each version is given a distinguishing version number.
      If the<br />
      Program specifies that a certain numbered version of
      the GNU Affero General<br />
      Public License &quot;or any later version&quot;
      applies to it, you have the<br />
      option of following the terms and conditions either of
      that numbered<br />
      version or of any later version published by the Free
      Software<br />
      Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
      number of the<br />
      GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any
      version ever published<br />
      by the Free Software Foundation.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which
      future<br />
      versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can
      be used, that proxy's<br />
      public statement of acceptance of a version
      permanently authorizes you<br />
      to choose that version for the Program.
    </p>

    <p>
      Later license versions may give you additional or
      different<br />
      permissions. However, no additional obligations are
      imposed on any<br />
      author or copyright holder as a result of your
      choosing to follow a<br />
      later version.
    </p>

    <p>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</p>

    <p>
      THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT
      PERMITTED BY<br />
      APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN
      WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br />
      HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM
      &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY<br />
      OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
      BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br />
      THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
      FOR A PARTICULAR<br />
      PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
      PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br />
      IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
      ASSUME THE COST OF<br />
      ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
    </p>

    <p>16. Limitation of Liability.</p>

    <p>
      IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
      AGREED TO IN WRITING<br />
      WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO
      MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br />
      THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
      DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br />
      GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
      ARISING OUT OF THE<br />
      USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT
      LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br />
      DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
      SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br />
      PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH
      ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br />
      EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
      THE POSSIBILITY OF<br />
      SUCH DAMAGES.
    </p>

    <p>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</p>

    <p>
      If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of
      liability provided<br />
      above cannot be given local legal effect according to
      their terms,<br />
      reviewing courts shall apply local law that most
      closely approximates<br />
      an absolute waiver of all civil liability in
      connection with the<br />
      Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability
      accompanies a<br />
      copy of the Program in return for a fee.
    </p>

    <p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

    <p>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</p>

    <p>
      If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of
      the greatest<br />
      possible use to the public, the best way to achieve
      this is to make it<br />
      free software which everyone can redistribute and
      change under these terms.
    </p>

    <p>
      To do so, attach the following notices to the program.
      It is safest<br />
      to attach them to the start of each source file to
      most effectively<br />
      state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
      have at least<br />
      the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where
      the full notice is found.
    </p>

    <p>
      &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief
      idea of what it does.&gt;<br />
      Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;
    </p>

    <p>
      This program is free software: you can redistribute it
      and/or modify<br />
      it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public
      License as published<br />
      by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of
      the License, or<br />
      (at your option) any later version.
    </p>

    <p>
      This program is distributed in the hope that it will
      be useful,<br />
      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied
      warranty of<br />
      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

      If your software can interact with users remotely
      through a computer<br />
      network, you should also make sure that it provides a
      way for users to<br />
      get its source. For example, if your program is a web
      application, its<br />
      interface could display a &quot;Source&quot; link that
      leads users to an archive<br />
      of the code. There are many ways you could offer
      source, and different<br />
      solutions will be better for different programs; see
      section 13 for the<br />
      specific requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
      You should also get your employer (if you work as a
      programmer) or school,<br />
      if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for
      the program, if necessary.<br />
